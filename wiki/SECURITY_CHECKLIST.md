# Docker Security Checklist

## Pre-Build Security Checks

### 1. Base Image Security
- [ ] Use latest secure base image (python:3.11-slim)
- [ ] Check for CVEs in base image using `docker scan python:3.11-slim`
- [ ] Consider using distroless images for production if possible
- [ ] Verify base image source and authenticity

### 2. System Package Updates
- [ ] Run `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y` in Dockerfile
- [ ] Install only necessary packages with `--no-install-recommends`
- [ ] Clean up package cache with `rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`
- [ ] Remove unnecessary packages after installation

### 3. Python Package Security
- [ ] Upgrade pip to latest version
- [ ] Upgrade setuptools to latest version (addresses CVE-2025-47273, CVE-2024-6345)
- [ ] Use `--no-cache-dir` for pip installations
- [ ] Pin package versions in requirements.txt
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies

### 4. Container Security
- [ ] Run as non-root user
- [ ] Set proper file permissions
- [ ] Use multi-stage builds when possible
- [ ] Minimize attack surface by removing unnecessary tools
- [ ] Implement health checks

## Post-Build Security Validation

### 1. Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Scan with Docker's built-in scanner
docker scan yourl-cloud:latest

# Scan with Trivy (recommended)
trivy image yourl-cloud:latest

# Scan with Snyk
snyk container test yourl-cloud:latest
```

### 2. Security Testing
- [ ] Test container runs as non-root user
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in image layers
- [ ] Check for exposed ports and services
- [ ] Validate health check functionality
- [ ] Test application security endpoints

### 3. Runtime Security
- [ ] Monitor container logs for security events
- [ ] Implement resource limits
- [ ] Use secrets management for sensitive data
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Regular security updates

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Container Hardening
- Use minimal base images
- Run as non-root user
- Implement proper logging
- Use secrets management
- Regular security updates

### 2. Network Security
- Use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Monitor network traffic
- Use VPN for sensitive operations

### 3. Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- Session management
- Error handling without information disclosure

## Compliance and Standards

### 1. Industry Standards
- [ ] OWASP Container Security Top 10
- [ ] CIS Docker Benchmark
- [ ] NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- [ ] ISO 27001 (if applicable)

### 2. Regulatory Compliance
